        <div class="project-blog">
            <p>This was possibly my first ever "project" as everything before this was just following tutorials, learning basic python syntax and simple scripts.
            I love solving problems and this was my first question as a programmer, "how does hitboxes work?". So I dived into a project with pygame and started referring to
            random articles on the internet to get the basic character and enemies, coded the random spawning of enemies. As it is very clear that I was inexperienced, since I did not use
            objects for the character and enemies (which would have made it 1000x better).</p>
            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>Understanding the logic and mathematics behind a problem is fascinating, I learned how to think like a computer and how we can make the computer
                calculate values to get a predictable result which can be used in a game. I learned how to methodically approach a problem and break down it into isolated and smaller
                problems, then make the computer understand what to do with that information.Although the code is not professional nor follows any structure, it still served its purpose to
                elevate my skills.</p>
            <h3>Conceptual design</h3>
            <p>
            The objects are colliding only when the plane of the bullet intersects with the plane of the enemy. Lets consider three events:
            <pre>
                1. the position of A and B of the bullet is <strong>less</strong> than the position of C and D of enemy.
                2. the position of A and C of the bullet is <strong>more</strong> than the position of A and C of the enemy.
                3. the position of B and D of the bullet is <strong>less</strong> than the position of B and D of the enemy.

            </pre>
            </p>
