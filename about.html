<p>Welcome to my corner of the web! I'm Awsaf (if you did not notice the giant heading), a passionate and dedicated programmer hailing from Toronto. I am a student of
    George brown college as a Bangladeshi international student studying programming. From writing <code style="background-color: #37373b;color: #cc802c">"print(Hello world)"</code>
    to simple applications, I knew this was the one thing I could never get tired of.I am still a work in progress, but just like technology in the modern world, I grow with time.
    Currently, I am focusing on <strong>Python</strong>,<strong>Java</strong>,<strong>C#</strong>,<strong>PHP</strong>, and <strong>Javascript</strong> and worked on some projects
    both personal and collaborations
</p>

<p>
    I believe in the <strong>power of collaboration</strong> and continuous learning. The tech world is a vast and ever-expanding landscape, and staying at the forefront of innovation is essential. I am committed to staying curious, embracing new technologies, and sharing knowledge with the community.
</p>
<p>Besides coding, I am a huge nerd for mathematics,simply because maths is about problems waiting to be solved. Fortunately, one of my strong subjects just happen to
    be a core part of programming. I am still exploring the world of programming and science, and I will not stop as I think there is simply no end to learning.<br>
    I am also into collaborating and talking with other programmers so<br>
    <strong>Feel free to contact me to connect with me, Happy coding <3</strong>
